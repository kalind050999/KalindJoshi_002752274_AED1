In this assignment we have made a health application in which there is a person who if they are sick will become a patient and can search for a hospital. Once they search for doctor in their community, they can book an appointment with the doctor.
On the doctor side, the doctor can view their appointments and they can also add encounters when a patient visit them. 
There are different communities in a city and every community has hospitals.
There are hospital admins, system admins and community admin who will be able to do the CRUD operations in their respective fields. The system admin can basically have access to all of the operations of the application.
I have made 15 classes in model package and on the UI side there are six panels with a mainframe panel.
