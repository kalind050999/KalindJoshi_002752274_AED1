* Description of the assignment:

There is a MainFrame panel which has four buttons i.e. Add, View Update and Search. 

First of all the user has to create an employee record where they have to enter details like Name, Employee ID, Email ID, Info, Title and there are validation for fields of mobile number and email ID among others.

After the user has been recorded successfully then we can view the employee details which have been added previously and we have to select the employee from the list and you can see the whole record when we click on View.

Then there is an update option where you can select which field you need to update and then other field to type the new updated value.

Lastly there is a search option where you can search an employee on the basis of fields like Name, Employee ID, Cell Phone and as soon as you click on search you will see the records if they exist otherwise you will see an error.

* Software used: Apache NetBeans 15
